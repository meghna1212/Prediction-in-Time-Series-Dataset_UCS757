In this problem statement, we are given a time-series dataset, DATASET ROAD, having data for different subsections of a road that is approximately 25 kilometers.

An IoT based company has deployed electronic sensors in order to get the data for 13 different pre-defined parameters and this data has been collected for over 10 years.

We need to use this time-series data in order to predict the values of the Parameters 9,10,11,12 and 13 for the 10th year and compare the predicted values and actual values.

The model that we will use for this purpose is XGBoost Regressor and the Total Root Mean Square Error that we obtain using this mode is 26.2587%
